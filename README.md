# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is the third project of the cs50 web programming course.In this project, I've build a website where one can order pizzas , subway sandwiches, pastas, platters and more.The website uses the Django python framework, javasscript, bootstrap, CSS and HTML.

The models.py consists of :
    - Models for different items (regularpizza model, sicillian pizza model etc).
    - Cart model (with 'pending' and 'complete' for transactions)

The following HTML files are present:
    - Index
    - Login
    - Register
    - Cart
    - Orders (for superuser)
    - Order details

My personal touch adds a quantity button as well as a 'complete' button incase the admin (owner) is done with a specific order.
